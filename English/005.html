To study and implement the 19th party spirit, we should fully understand the close relationship between the four greats.

Only by deepening the great new project of party building and constantly enhancing the party's political leadership, ideological leadership, mass organization and social appeal can we provide strong political guarantee for the realization of the great dream. Only by consistently adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and more consciously enhancing the "four self-confidence" can we pave the way for the realization of the great dream. Among the "four greats", what plays a decisive role is the great new project of party building. Combined with great struggle, a great career, and push the great project, the practice of the great dream it is to uphold and improve the party's leadership, to be more strong and unwavering commitment to the party construction, to ensure that our party has always been one of the leading enterprises in times, has become the mainstay of the national people's, always be strong leadership core, the communist party of China we will be able to shoulder the historical mission of the new era, new great historical contribution for the Chinese nation. <br>

Today, we are closer than at any time in history to the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We are fully confident and capable of realizing the great dream and delivering new and better answers to history and the people. <br>
