	Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, and in accordance with the overall plan of deepening the reform in an all-round way by the Central Committee, the Party has publicized the cultural front to strengthen cultural self-confidence, enhance cultural consciousness, tightly revolve around the goal of a well-off culture, and insist on putting social benefits first and realizing social and economic benefits. Unification, the promotion of cultural reform and development of the tasks of landing results, cultural innovation and creativity greatly stimulated the construction of a socialist cultural power has taken a solid step.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	<strong>Filling in short board to improve efficiency, modern public cultural service system construction enters the fast lane of development.</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	First look at a set of figures: in 2016, the national cultural expenditure of 77.069 billion yuan, an increase of 60.5 percent over 2012; in 2016, the total collection of Public Libraries in the country 900 million, the national per capita ownership of public libraries from 0.51 volumes (pieces) in 2012 to 0.65 volumes (pieces); in 2016, the national mass cultural institutions to carry out activities 1.84 million times, Serving 579 million people, an increase of 52% and 32% respectively over 2012. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In the past five years, the construction of modern public cultural service system has entered the fast lane of development. Relevant departments around the country adhere to the government-led, social participation, shift the focus of gravity, build and share, complement shortcomings, improve efficiency, and open up the "last kilometer" of public cultural services. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The top level design of public cultural service system is constantly improving. The Central Office and the State Office issued the Opinions on Accelerating the Construction of a Modern Public Cultural Service System, making standardized equalization an important institutional design and work for the first time, and promulgated the Law on the Guarantee of Public Cultural Services, bringing public cultural construction into the orbit of legalization and standardization. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The allocation of public cultural resources is further tilted to the grass-roots level. Since 2012, the central government has invested 1.6 billion yuan to support the construction and expansion of 214 prefectural and municipal public libraries, museums and cultural centers. The Ministry of Culture and other departments jointly issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Construction of the General Branch System of the Library of the County-level Cultural Museum, and transferred the high-quality resources of the county-level cultural museums and libraries to the countryside. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The effectiveness of public cultural services has been significantly improved. Shanghai has created a "cultural Shanghai cloud" to enable massive public cultural information to form large public cultural data; cultural supermarkets in Qingdao, Chengdu, Jiaozuo and other places have adopted personalized, "order-based" services to meet the diversified needs of the masses; and cultural Huimin cards have been issued in Beijing, Tianjin, Hefei, Dalian, Qingdao, Quanzhou and Huizhou. "We will package the preferential cultural products and give the masses the right to choose independently. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	<strong>The cultural market system is further improving and the cultural industry is developing vigorously. </strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The winners of the 14th "Five One Projects" for the construction of spiritual civilization were announced recently. The TV documentary "Will Reform Go to the End", "The Wolf of War", "The Begonia Still", "The Anesthetist" and "The Great Should Be Understood: Read Mao Zedong Together" were listed in 67 works. These ideological, artistic and ornamental literary and artistic works have won praise and acceptance, box office and distribution harvest, which is a vivid example of the growing prosperity of China's cultural market since the 18th National Congress. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">

<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Over the past five years, various localities and relevant departments have adapted to the new normal of economic development, focusing on the supply side, actively constructing modern cultural market system and cultural industry system, improving the quality and efficiency of cultural industry development, and striving to promote cultural industry as a pillar industry of the national economy. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	<strong>Speeding up the pace of going out, China's story attracts the world's attention.</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Since eighteen, the guiding opinions on Further Strengthening and improving the work of Chinese culture going out, the opinions on accelerating the development of foreign cultural trade, and the guiding opinions on strengthening the soft power construction of "one belt and one road" have been issued. The good Chinese story has spread the voice of China well. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	With the construction of "one belt and one road", we deepened cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and foreign countries. We feel that the influence of China, Chinese culture year, happy Spring Festival and other brand activities has been expanded and the results are obvious. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In the Spring Festival of 2016, the global distribution platform of "Chinese Film Putian" was officially launched, and has been successfully docked with the mainstream courtyards in Asia, Europe and North America. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	On the international stage, the Chinese story that highlights the innovation of the times has attracted applause from all sides: Peking Opera master Zhang Huoding entered the Lincoln Center in New York, successfully performed the full-length Peking Opera "White Snake" and "Lock Lin bag"; the Shanghai Kun Opera Troupe brought Tang Xianzu's "Four Dreams of Linchuan" to the stage for the first time and opened a world tour, where the grand occasion was unprecedented; A group of Chinese writers such as Cao Wenxuan, Liu Cixin and Liu Zhenyun walked in the spotlight of the international prize stage. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In ancient times, the way of literature is loaded. Chinese culture is becoming a brilliant business card for China to go to the world. Cultural self-confidence is providing a powerful spiritual impetus for the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
