	<strong>核心观点</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">
	
	● The new statements in the Nineteenth Congress address the principal contradictions in society, not in economic development or material and cultural life. We must think closely about the theme of the principal contradiction of our society, the focus of which can not be deviated, we must grasp the principal contradiction and its main aspects of our society, and the train of thought should not be narrow. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">

	● As for the basic national conditions, it is mainly from a country's most fundamental, the most essential social nature of the point of view. After hard work, with the accumulation of the evolution of the national conditions in the general sense, there will be some periodic local changes in the basic national conditions, and there will be a process from quantitative to qualitative change, but this is a long historical process, and it is not easy to make a fundamental change. 
</p>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">

	●The change of principal contradiction reflects the change from the contradiction of supply and demand at lower level to that of supply and demand at middle and high level, from the contradiction of supply and demand of "quantity shortage" to the contradiction of supply and demand of "shortage of quality". 
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">
	
	●General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out in his report to the 19th National Congress that "the main social contradictions in our country have been translated into a contradiction between the growing needs of the people for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development." This new social principal contradiction is the scientific basis for judging socialism with Chinese characteristics entering the new era and the important characteristic of the new era. A thorough understanding of this new major thesis is the logical prerequisite for understanding accurately the entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">
	<strong>
			Clarifying the main contradictions of Society is the basis of formulating correct policies and principles
	</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">
	

	The previous statements about the main social contradictions in our country originated from the resolution on political report of the eighth Congress of the Party in 1956. At that time, in the task of realizing socialist transformation, China entered a new historical position in the period of comprehensive socialist construction. The eighth National Congress clearly put forward: "the principal contradictions in our country," It is already a contradiction between the people's demand for the establishment of an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country. It is already a contradiction between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current situation in which the economy and culture cannot meet the needs of the people. " 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">


	To clear up the main social contradictions is the basis for the Party and the state to formulate the correct line, principles and policies, and the basis for the establishment of the development concept and development strategy. In the later period of time, our party's understanding of the principal social contradictions was not clear and firm enough, and even experienced some twists and turns, which brought negative impact to the construction and development of the country. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">
	

	The third Plenary session of the Eleventh Central Committee in 1978 realized a historical turning point, which was reflected in the understanding of the principal social contradictions. The resolution on certain historical issues of the Party since the founding of the people's Republic of China, adopted in 1981 at the sixth Plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, formally summarized the principal social contradictions: "after the socialist transformation has basically been completed, The principal contradiction to be solved in our country is the contradiction between the growing material and cultural needs of the people and the backward social production. " There are two changes in this expression: first, the contradiction between the requirements of establishing advanced industrial countries and the reality of backward agricultural countries no longer exists from the level of national development; Second, "the contradiction between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current economic and cultural inability to meet the needs of the people" should be changed to "the contradiction between the people's growing material and cultural needs and the backward social production." These two changes not only carry on the essential contents of the eight major statements, but also reflect certain changes in the national conditions, which make the statements of the principal contradictions in society more concise and concentrated. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; line-height:190%;">


	 Since then, each party Congress must reaffirm the social principal contradiction question. At the same time, with the continuous development of productive forces and social progress, since the 16th National Congress, there have been some changes in context. Basically, it is necessary to point out that the cause of socialist construction with Chinese characteristics has some new stage characteristics in the course of development, and then add "still yes" before the principal social contradictions, or "remain unchanged" in the suffix. This is because the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed that China "has generally realized the historic leap from food and clothing to a well-off society" and "entered the development stage of building a well-off society in an all-round way." since then, The stage characteristics of the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics are becoming more and more obvious, and the main social contradictions imply the possibility of transformation in the future.
