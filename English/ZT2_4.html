	Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the "community of destiny" has begun to take shape, from the concept of green development into production and life, to economic development and ecological improvement to achieve benign interaction. The CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has pushed the construction of ecological civilization to a new height and opened a new prospect of beautiful China. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	<strong>From protection to restoration, efforts should be made to make up the short board of ecology. </strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In 2015, from the Great Hinggan Mountains in the west, to the Changbai Mountains in the east, and to the Xiao Hinggan Mountains in the north, thousands of kilometers of primitive forests, the endless sound of logging stopped abruptly for thousands of years. Hundreds of thousands of lumberjacks have sealed axes and saws and stopped cutting in key state-owned forest areas, ending years of excessive demand for forests. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Behind this historic change is a new realm of ecological civilization. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	At the 18th National Congress of the CPC, the construction of ecological civilization has been brought into the overall layout of the "five in one" cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and "beautiful China" has become a new goal pursued by the Chinese nation. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Over the past five years, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has firmly established the idea that protecting the ecological environment means protecting the productive forces and improving the ecological environment means developing the productive forces, and has made great efforts to complement the ecological shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	 -to restore terrestrial ecology, and to make the world more green. Over the past five years, China has increased more than 90 million mu of afforestation every year. With the improvement of forest quality, the utilization rate of improved varieties increased from 51% to 61%, and the qualified rate of afforestation seedlings remained above 90%. A total of 48.95 million mu of national reserve forest was built. 300 thousand hectares of degraded wetlands were restored and 200 thousand mu of farmland returned to wet land. The 118 cities become "National Forest cities". The three north project started the construction of two million mu shelter forest base. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	- prevention and control of soil erosion and the foundation of the earth. Over the past five years, 126 million mu of desertified land has been harnessed in China. Desertification has been curbed as a whole and the key harnessing areas have been markedly improved. The area of desertified land has been reduced by an average of 1980 square kilometers annually, thus realizing the historical transformation from "sand into sand and retreat" to "people into sand and retreat". </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	- restoring aquatic ecosystems and returning home to life. The proportion of class I-III water in the state-controlled section of surface water increased to 67.8%, and that of class V water decreased to 8.6%. The water quality in the main stream of the great rivers has been steadily improved. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	"We have spent more than 30 years in the course of 300 years'development in the western developed countries. Environmental damage is unavoidable, but we can realize the importance of ecology in the development of human civilization in the high-speed development stage, avoid the detour of"pollution before treatment"and improve the ability of sustainable development." Xin Ming, a professor at the Central Party school. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	<strong>From system to practice, speed up and speed up green development.</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The anclents sald: if you hope the wood qrows long, you should fiem the root. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Since the eighteen Party's Congress, the "four pillars and eight pillars" of the top-level design of ecological civilization construction have been improving day by day. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In the past five years, the top-level design of ecological civilization has been gradually improved. In April 2015, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the Opinions on Accelerating the Construction of Ecological Civilization, which clarified the overall requirements, objectives, vision, key tasks and system of the construction of ecological civilization. In September of the same year, the General Plan for the Reform of the Ecological Civilization System was promulgated. The system of property rights of natural resources, the system of land and space development and protection, and the system of performance appraisal and accountability for ecological civilization were put forward. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In the past five years, the construction of the legal system for ecological environment protection has been continuously improving. Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan, Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan and Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan have been promulgated successively. The new environmental protection law, known as "the most stringent in history", has been implemented since 2015, and has made unprecedented efforts to crack down on environmental crimes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In the past five years, the supervision and enforcement of ecological environmental protection has been unprecedentedly unprecedented. Pressure reduction of coal burning, elimination of yellow standard cars, control of enterprises that do not meet the emission standards, start the prevention and control of atmospheric pollution to strengthen supervision.. A series of environmental protection punches bring more blue sky and clear water. Compared with 2013, the average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region decreased by 33%, in the Yangtze River Delta region by 31.3%, and in the Pearl River Delta region by 31.9%. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In the past five years, China has actively participated in international governance and made green contributions. At the Paris Conference on Climate Change in December 2015, 196 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted the Paris Agreement as a historic document to make arrangements for global response to climate change after 2020. China is not only an important driving force for reaching an agreement, but also a firm performing country. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	<strong>From concept to effectiveness, economic and social development is moving towards a higher level.</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	During the G20 summit, Hangzhou, with its flourishing and Ancient Rhymes, amazed the world. While enjoying the rapid development of the "trillion-dollar club" and wandering through the ancient charm and beauty of the lake city, Hangzhou has solved the problem of protection and development, realized the positive interaction between ecology and economy, and become a "beautiful China pioneer area". </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In 2016, 183 thousand tons of afforestation and carbon sequestration were sold on the Beijing Environmental Exchange, Sai Han Ba forest farm. All 475 tons of carbon sinks can be traded for more than 100 million yuan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	"The wilderness has become a forest, the forest has changed into green water and green hills, green water and green hills have become mountains of gold and silver in silence, and Saihanba has formed a virtuous cycle of development chain." Sai Han Ba forest yard deputy director Chen Zhiqing said. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The increasing supply of ecological products has greatly increased people's sense of acquisition from the "green earth" to "green around" and "green heart sowing". Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's forest area and storage have increased to 3.12 billion mu and 15.1 billion cubic meters, respectively. The annual ecological service value of these forest resources is 12.68 trillion yuan. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The concept of green development is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The Ministry of Environmental Protection has opened a "12369" Wechat reporting platform for environmental protection, broadening the channels and scope of mass participation, and accepting more than 73,000 reports from the masses. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Under the guidance of the concept of green development, energy consumption and water consumption per unit GDP in 2016 decreased by 17.9% and 25.4% respectively compared with 2012, with significant emission reduction effect of major pollutants. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's ecological civilization construction has shown a new situation of accelerated development, China's economic development momentum is undergoing a fundamental change, and the advantages and potential of backwardness are unlimited. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In the lower reaches of the Jinsha River, the Baihetan Hydropower Station, the world's largest hydropower station under construction, has been fully constructed recently. After its completion, the average annual power generation capacity will reach 62.443 billion kilowatt-hours. The average annual consumption of standard coal will be reduced by 19.68 million tons, and the carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced by 51.6 million tons. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	China's green development has contributed to the world's China programme. In 2016, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) issued a report entitled "Green Water and Green Mountains are Golden Mountain and Silver Mountain: China's Strategy and Action for Ecological Civilization". The idea and experience of China's ecological civilization construction is providing an important reference for the sustainable development of the whole world. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	A beautiful new picture of China, full of hope and confidence, is being laid in full. </p>
