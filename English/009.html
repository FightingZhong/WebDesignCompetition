　　She is a worthy match in the eyes of lawyers<br/>


　　Since middle school, Chen yongjie has been following his father, a prosecutor, and interested in court proceedings. When he became a prosecutor, Chen grew rapidly from a nervous courtroom to a sweaty palm to the youngest prosecution expert in qinghai province. <br/>

　　During the trial, a defense attorney pleaded not guilty and the accused distorted his facts. To this, Chen yongjie made full use of the evidence, one by one refuted the defender's point of view. The court eventually adopted all the qualitative and sentencing recommendations of the procuratorial organs, and imposed heavier penalties on the defendants who had clear criminal facts and solid evidence, but still did not show remorse. <br/>


　　At the end of the trial, a lawyer who had faced off in court sent a message to Chen yongjie: "I admire your ability and level of defense." <br/>

　　In the trial, ma fuxin found that Chen yongjie, referring to any of the defendants, could make it clear what facts were involved and which pages were corresponding to the files. "I feel like she's seen the files at least 10 times, and that dedication is worth learning." Said malfoy. <br/>


　　She is a very good researcher in the eyes of her colleagues

After years of efforts, she has developed excellent professional skills and excellent language expression skills, especially her ability to make the three parties satisfied in public prosecution is very valuable. "At first, as a leader, he looked down on Chen yongjie. Gradually, they began to look up, but now he is looking up at her," he joked. <br/>

As the head of the public prosecution department, Chen yongjie also attaches great importance to the common progress of the whole team. In the office of public prosecution, there are two books on everyone's desk all year round. Li zhijuan, a young prosecutor in the public prosecution department, said that under Chen yongjie's leadership, everyone's learning momentum is very full.<br/>
