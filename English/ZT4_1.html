	Great times lead the way forward and tide surges forward.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has taken charge of the overall situation and coordinated all the parties concerned. The Party's leadership has been strengthened in an all-round way at the above-mentioned rate and at various levels, and the new great project of Party building has been advanced in depth, so as to further enhance the Party's cohesion, combat effectiveness, leadership and appeal. A stronger party is piloting the USS China on the road to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	<strong>Coordinating the overall situation</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	"The 5 years since the eighteen largest party has been a very extraordinary 5 year in the development of the party and the state." On July 26, General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at a seminar on leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels. He made a profound summary from nine aspects of the extraordinary five years since the 18th National Congress of the CPC. Among the "nine extraordinary events", the first is to strengthen the Party's leadership in an all-round way, which has greatly enhanced the Party's cohesion, combat effectiveness, leadership and appeal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In the Quartet, we must be in the center. Adhering to the party's leadership is first of all adhering to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has personally become the leader of leading groups such as the Central Committee's leading group on comprehensive deepening of reform and the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economics. The Central Committee has further strengthened its leadership in economic, political, cultural, social, ecological and civilized construction, military and national defense construction. Guide... The Party's role in taking the overall situation into account and coordinating all parties has become the fundamental guarantee for overcoming all kinds of risks and challenges. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The party, government, the army and the people's studies, the East, the West, the Middle East, the Middle East, the party is leading everything.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee hears reports from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National People's Political Consultative Conference, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, which is an important institutional arrangement to ensure the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The Central United Front Work Conference, the Central Party's Group Work Conference, the Party's Press and Public Opinion Work Forum, the National State-owned Enterprise Party Construction Work Conference, the National University Ideological and Political Work Conference, the Army's Political Work Conference... General Secretary Xi Jinping attended and delivered important speeches on the convening of important conferences in each relevant field, mobilizing and deploying all the work.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The theory, line, principles and policies formulated by the Party Central Committee have become the basis and basis for the unified thinking, will and action of the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all nationalities.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	A country, a nation, a political party, and a core of leadership are essential.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	In the golden autumn of 2016, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the CPC clearly defined the central position of General Secretary Xi Jinping in the whole Party, which is the common will of the whole Party, the common aspiration of the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all nationalities, and lays a solid political foundation for further strengthening the centralized and unified leadership of the Party.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	<strong>Strong base, solid foundation</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	“One family in Dawan Village is not out of poverty, I will not withdraw from the post!” Yu Jing, the first secretary of Dawan Village, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province made a promise to the people in the village. In the past two years, Yu Jing took root in the mountains and led the local people to get rid of poverty and make the Dawan Village's precision poverty alleviation work achieve remarkable results.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The ordinary people have repeatedly felt: on the road to poverty, the party organization is our "backbone", the first secretary is our "leading geese", and we have a good life with us!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	During the four years from 2013 to 2016, 55.64 million Chinese were lifted out of poverty, equivalent to the total population of a large European country. China’s achievements in poverty alleviation have attracted worldwide attention.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	"The train runs fast, all depends on the headband." The 195,000 outstanding cadres selected by the central government came to the countryside. As the "first secretary", they became the "leading geese" in the front line of poverty alleviation. The grass-roots party organizations and the improvement of the level of governance have played an important role in making the party’s cohesive force’s combat effectiveness significantly improved at the grassroots level.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The elders who seek for wood will be solid.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the construction of the Party has been strengthened in an all-round way and extended to the grass-roots level. The role of grass-roots Party organizations in all walks of life has been greatly enhanced. The Party's banner has been flying high in the grass-roots positions. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	——Ideals and beliefs are more firm. From 2013 onwards, we will continue to carry out the Party's mass line education, the "three stringencies and three realities" special subject education, the "two studies and one practice" study education and institutionalize the normalization of learning and education. Education will guide the broad masses of Party members and cadres to supplement the "calcium" spirit, build a "foundation" of belief, greatly enhance Party members'ideological understanding, and promote the Party's ideological awareness. The consciousness of sexual cultivation has been greatly improved. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	——The Battle Fortress is stronger. We should focus on the overall management of grass-roots party organizations in various fields. In the cities, we should strengthen the leading core position of the Party organizations in the neighborhood communities, promote the interaction among the Party building in the neighborhood communities, the Party building in the units, the Party building in the trades and the Party building in all fields; in the state-owned enterprises, we should incorporate the Party building requirements into the articles of Association and the leadership of the Party into the corporate governance; and in Colleges and universities, we should adhere to and improve the leadership of the Party committees in Colleges and universities. The implementation of the principal responsibility system and other documents, the Party's leadership throughout the whole process of running a school; to park as a leader, strengthen the party building work of non-public enterprises, strengthen the political core role of Party organizations in social organizations, the weak and scattered grass-roots party organizations to carry out continuous rectification. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	——The cage of the system is getting stronger and stronger. Governing the country is constant and governing the party is important. Over the past five years, the Central Committee has issued or revised nearly 80 inner-party laws and regulations, more than 40% of the existing ones, making the strict administration of the Party and the strict administration of officials more and more rule-based and evidence-based. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	——The vanguard role of Party members is brought into full play. In the front line of poverty alleviation, in the main battlefield of reform and development, in the forefront of flood fighting and emergency rescue, there are active figures of selfless dedication and hard work of the broad masses of Party members everywhere. A number of advanced models, such as Liao Junbo, Huang Danian and Xie Qiao, set an example for the broad masses of Party members and cadres, and transmit positive energy for the community. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Today, more than 4.5 million Party organizations are becoming more than 4.5 million combat fortresses, and more than 89 million Party members are becoming the advanced model of more than 89 million office workers and entrepreneurship, closely linking the party with the flesh and blood of the people, and gathering into an irresistible force. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	<strong>Self-revolution, rejuvenation</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee has taken strengthening and standardizing the political life within the Party as an important grasp. It has gathered the soul through theoretical armed forces, intensified the style of work through rectification, strengthened restraint through strict discipline, punished corruption through "beating tigers", "swat flies" and "hunting foxes", and has the determination and courage to be introverted and self-revolutionary with a knife blade. It has effectively solved the outstanding problems existing in the Party, greatly strengthened the Party's cohesion, combat effectiveness, leadership and appeal, and brought about a new style of Party conduct and government.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has deliberated and adopted the "Several Guidelines on Political Life within the Party under the New Situation" and the "Regulations on Supervision within the Party of the Communist Party of China", which is an important arrangement for the Party Central Committee to focus on the comprehensive and strict administration of the Party, adhere to the ideological construction of the Party and the system of Party .</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	It takes a good blacksmith to make steel. Strictly administering the Party in an all-round way will keep the Party's political nature, keep its vitality and forge a stronger leadership. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	——Clean up with a clean style. By the end of June 2017, more than 170,000 mental problems and more than 130,000 punishments had been investigated and dealt with in violation of the Eight Provisions of the Central Committee. Up to now, the "eight provisions" have become a household word and are popular among the people. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	——Tiger beating flies keep high pressure. More than 200 cadres were in charge during the case-filing examination, more than 1 million leading cadres were disciplined, nearly 3,000 people were recovered from fleeing places, and the high-pressure situation of punishing corruption was always maintained, so that the goal of daring not to corrupt was initially realized, and the overwhelming situation of anti-corruption struggle had taken shape. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	——Strict administration of officials should be guided by personnel. In recent years, we have revised the Regulations on the Selection and Appointment of Leading Cadres of the Party and Government and the Regulations on the Education and Training of Cadres, issued the Opinions on Preventing the "Promotion of Cadres with Diseases", and revised and issued the Code for Discussing and Deciding on the Appointment and Removal of Cadres by the Party Committee (Party Group)... Gradually promote the formation of a good personnel orientation and institutional environment. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The survey by the National Bureau of Statistics shows that the people's satisfaction with the work of building a clean and honest Party style and anti-corruption has increased from 81% in 2013 to 92.9% in 2016. The party has fulfilled the solemn promise of "fighting iron needs to be hard" and won the hearts and minds of the party.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The vivid practice of the strict administration of the Party in an all-round way further strengthens the central role of the Party's leadership and makes it a fundamental guarantee for all undertakings. Entering a new stage of development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the China Huge Ship is carrying the great dream of the Chinese people to break the waves and advance toward a glorious shore.
