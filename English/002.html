                    　　"On the other side of the world, something truly historic just happened." At the close of the 19th national congress of the communist party of China, the exclamation from foreign media reflected the high attention paid by the international community to this "global conference". In the new era, China is increasingly approaching the center of the world stage and making greater contributions to mankind. China's development is not only about the well-being of its 1.3 billion people, but also about the future of the world.<br>

　　"the CPC is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people, and is also a party that strives for the cause of human progress."In the report, the party's 19 xi general secretary raised the banner of peace, development and cooperation, win-win, domestic and international two as a whole, clear powers diplomacy with Chinese characteristics to promote the building new international relationships, promote to build human destiny community, to a new era of diplomatic work further direction, deployment, reveal the destiny of our party to human thinking, as to the cause of world peace and development.<br>

　　Over the past five years, China's diplomacy, like kunpeng, has spread its wings and soared in the face of major development, changes and adjustments in the world. From the concept of "community of Shared future for mankind" to the construction of "One Belt And One Road", and to the brilliant home diplomacy, China's major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics has been promoted in an all-round manner, and China's international influence, appeal and shaping capacity have been further enhanced. Facts have proved that China has not only expanded the path of developing countries towards modernization, but also contributed Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to human problems. Standing at a new historical starting point, China's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics is faced with new requirements of The Times and needs to constantly display new actions and open up new frontiers in practice.<br>

　　To advance major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, we need to fully grasp the core and spiritual essence of building a new type of international relations. The 19th CPC national congress defined the new type of international relations as mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, which not only reflects the theme of the era of peace and development, but also points out the way to solve the challenges facing mankind. Mutual respect means respecting the right of people of all countries to independently choose their development paths. All countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal. Fairness and justice means upholding the concept of global governance through joint consultation and joint contribution and promoting democracy in international relations. Win-win cooperation means developing global partnership, deepening cooperation among countries in the right sense of justice and interests, and jointly addressing challenges and sharing opportunities. The practice of unremitting efforts to build a new type of international relations not only continues to create favorable external conditions for China's development, but also demonstrates to the world through concrete actions that China has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a supporter of international order.<br>

To advance major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era requires a profound understanding of the rich connotation and practical path of building a community of Shared future for mankind. To build a community of Shared future for mankind is to build a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness and clean and beautiful world. The key to lasting peace lies in mutual respect and consultation on an equal footing, the firm rejection of the cold war mentality and power politics, and the new path of state-to-state exchanges featuring dialogue rather than confrontation and partnership rather than alliance. Ensuring universal security, resolving disputes through dialogue and resolving differences through consultation are the only way forward. To achieve common prosperity, we need to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win. To be open and inclusive, we need to respect the diversity of civilizations, transcend barriers between civilizations through exchanges, transcend conflicts among civilizations through mutual learning, and transcend the superiority of civilizations through coexistence. To protect the clean and beautiful, we must adhere to environmental friendliness and protect the earth home on which human beings live. The fate of the world is in the hands of all peoples, and the future of mankind depends on the choice of all peoples. All countries will work together to build a community of Shared future for mankind and jointly create a better future for mankind. <br>


We should pursue a just cause for common good. China's new era is also a new opportunity for the world. Guided by xi jinping thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and keeping pace with The Times and forging ahead, China's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics has great potential, and the lofty cause of peace and development of mankind will embrace a brighter future.<br>
