	Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era adheres to problem-oriented thinking and applies strategic thinking and dialectical thinking from the perspective of linking history and reality, linking international and domestic, and combining theory with practice. The bottom line thinking and question thinking are full of philosophical wisdom to understand and grasp the problems of China and the world, which not only contain Marxist stand, viewpoint, method, but also have the characteristics of times and practice innovation, ideas and character.

	In the strategic thinking of all parties. The Nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China closely combined with the new conditions of the times and the requirements of practice, from a strategic height, made the major political assertion that "through long-term efforts, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, which is a new historical orientation for the development of our country." From the perspective of "eight clear" and "14 adherence", the rich connotation, spiritual essence and basic strategy of Xi Jinping's socialist thoughts with Chinese characteristics in the new era have been profoundly explained. Scientific answers were given to the general objectives, general tasks, general layout, strategic layout and development direction, mode of development, motive force, strategic steps, external conditions, political guarantees, and so on, of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. In particular, we put forward the great struggle, great project, great cause and great dream as a unified whole, and stressed that "the decisive role is the new great project of party building". Leading cadres at all levels should improve their political position, strengthen their ability and determination to take the direction, seek the overall situation, formulate policies, and promote reform, deeply understand General Secretary Xi Jinping's strategic thinking of all sides from the overall perspective, and strive to grasp the direction of development from a strategic perspective. Solving the difficult problem of Reform from the overall situation

	Grasp the key in dialectical thinking. Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era has grasped the fundamental method of materialist dialectics, pointed out the strategic focus and the main direction of attack of the Party in the coming period, and embodied the key to grasp the key. The methodology of concentrating on solving major contradictions and major aspects of contradictions. In the overall layout of the "five in one" and the coordinated promotion of the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, leading cadres at all levels should especially learn to solve problems as a whole with dialectical thinking. It is necessary to adhere to the unity of the two points theory and the key theory. We should not only see great historical opportunities, but also strengthen our sense of suffering and guard against the risks and challenges. We should adhere to the combination of overall advancement and key breakthroughs, consider comprehensively, make overall efforts to advance, and seize the key areas of "pulling one hair and moving the whole body," and firmly grasp the key link of "one child falls and fills the whole body." It is necessary to adhere to the combination of top-level design and "crossing the river by touching the stone", which not only strengthens the top-level design at the institutional level, but also encourages bold experiments in practice.

	General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "we should be good at using the bottom line thinking method, prepare everything from the bad, strive for the best results, be prepared for no danger, not panic, firmly grasp the initiative." Bottom line thinking is a backward-looking scientific thinking method, its greatest feature is to focus on the transformation of contradictions. Hold on to the bottom line thinking, not only reflects the wisdom of General Secretary Xi Jinping in power, but also reflects his sense of worry and responsibility. We should make good use of the bottom line thinking to control risks, think deeply about all possible factors, think carefully about all kinds of countermeasures, from formulating macro-policies to formulating specific programs, we must accurately identify the shortcomings and draw the bottom line. The bottom line of students'work should focus on solving the outstanding problems of health, education, housing, food safety, environmental protection and so on.

	 Reform and innovation in problem thinking. Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics runs through a strong question orientation, answering a series of major theoretical and practical problems in upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, especially focusing on the comprehensive and strict administration of the party. The Party's political construction should be put in the first place, the ideological building of the party and the administration of the party should work together, and the party's construction should be promoted as a whole. Leading cadres at all levels should strengthen their thinking on problems, strengthen their guidance, be sharp in finding problems, face up to problems, and solve problems consciously. We should be good at finding problems, finding problems in the practice of reform and development, finding problems in summing up experiences and lessons, and finding problems in the suggestions and difficulties of the masses. We should dare to face up to the problem, consciously use dialectical materialism and historical materialism to analyze and study problems, and look for the key to solve the problem from the practice creation at the grass-roots level. We should be bold in solving problems, grasp major and difficult problems, turn problem consciousness into problem-oriented, and strive to pool positive energy of career development in problem-solving.
