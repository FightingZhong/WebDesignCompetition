	On the slag, the soil was moved to the field, and the road was repaired between the mountains... The film "Eight Cave Village", which is being filmed, is based on a poverty alleviation in Xiangxi Mountain Village. In the past five years, there have been more than 60 million people in China, and like the villagers in the 18-hole village, they have gone out of poverty. The historic changes have refreshed the face of China and brought China's development to the next starting point.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Walking in the new waters, where will China's huge ship sail? The report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed that from now until 2020, it will be a decisive period for the comprehensive construction of a well-off society. General Secretary Xi Jinping has drawn a blueprint for the development of the next 30 years. From 2020 to 2035, he will "strive for fifteen years and basically realize socialist modernization"; from 2035 to the middle of this century, he will basically realize modernization. On the basis of this, "fighting for another fifteen years, we will build China into a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful socialist modern power." Establishing new goals, planning strategic arrangements, and calibrating the direction of advancement. The new journey initiated by the 19th National Congress runs through the new era, embodies new ideas, demonstrates a new mission, and sends a mobilization order to win the great victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	The goal is like a lighthouse, guiding the journey of the ship to sail and break the waves. In different periods of development, our party can always change from time to time and with the system, and set great goals to encourage hundreds of millions of people to work together. In 1987, the 13th National Congress proposed "three steps" to lead the transition from subsistence to well-off; in 1997, the 15th National Congress planned a "new three-step", and it was confirmed that by 2010, the founding of the Party for 100 years and the founding of New China 100. The development goal of the year is anchored to the basic realization of modernization in the middle of the 21st century. Arriving for one of the previous goals, and proceeding toward the next goal. In this process, the "Chinese miracle" shocked the world.。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Today, we have upgraded our second century goal to “Building a strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful socialist modernization power”. This is due to the fact that China’s economy has grown at an average annual rate of over 9% in the past 40 years. The volume of the second is due to the substantial improvement of the people's living standards and the fundamental progress of all aspects of the cause. Such new goals and new journeys are rooted in the changes of the times and focus on the needs of the people. They also highlight the spirit of the contemporary communists seeking truth from facts, not forgetting the feelings of the initial heart, and bearing the responsibility of the mission.。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	Pushing the door to a new era, we have to embark on a new journey, still in the mountains and rivers, still need to be smashed. People have found that in the description of the socialist modernization power, there is the goal of "beauty." For the two fifteen-year vision, there are more contents such as "innovative country", "national governance system and governance capacity". In the report of the 19th National Congress, we will build a well-off society in an all-round way by coordinating the "five major constructions" and implementing the "seven major strategies". We will describe the socialist modernization blueprint with six goals, with "five keywords" and "five civilizations". To define a socialist modernization power, and to determine the spiritual pillar, source of strength, and action guide for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. It can be said that this conference not only opened up a new journey, but also paved the way to a strong country.。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	China’s new goals also inject strong confidence into the world. “No other country can have long-term development plans and short-term development goals like China.” “China’s institutional advantages are conducive to stimulating development vitality and maintaining policy stability and continuity.” Many Western scholars interpret China in this way. Successful password. When many countries are engaged in "boxing competitions", China has ran a historical "relay race" one after another, injecting strong momentum into the world economy and contributing Chinese wisdom and China's solution to world peace and development.。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
	"Working hard can make a dream come true." Leading a new journey with new ideas, perseverance, perseverance, maintaining a never-sluggish state of mind and a stance of struggle, the road under our feet will inevitably connect the endless future, from generation to generation. Arriving in a better tomorrow 。</p>
