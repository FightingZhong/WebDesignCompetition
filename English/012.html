　　At an altitude of 4,500 meters above sea level, a Tibetan drilling worker led his colleagues to put down roots in the field all year round: digging ditches, climbing snow mountains, and taking glaciers. Work line, love line, professional line; The small family, gu you, prospecting.............. <br>


　　To barzaxi, a delegate from the 19th CPC national congress, deputy manager of the engineering and surveying department of the sixth geological survey bureau of Tibet, senior technician for drilling. At 1.8 metres tall, with jet-black hair and tanned skin, he looked a bit shy. Perhaps having lived in a frozen working area for a long time, the 45-year-old has few words, and his words and deeds reveal the frankness and frankness. <br>


　　In the 26 years that he took root in the field of geological exploration, from an ordinary drill man to an "old expert" on the rig, he set a record of drilling more than 50, 000 metres into the average altitude of more than 5, 000 metres. He led the team of the ministry of construction and surveying, worked hard and innovated, and achieved economic and social benefits for many years, making due contributions to the geological cause. <br>


　　The old expert on the exploration rig<br>


　　Over the past 20 years and more, zaxi has participated in more than 20 drilling projects, including the grand battle of yulong copper mine in changdu, the gemma copper mine in mozhu gongka county, and the geological survey of energy resources in northern Tibet. He sticks to the high-altitude mining area of more than 5,000 meters for a long time and practices the spirit of "iron man" in the new era through practical actions. <br>


　　Geological man's suffering is the most clear to himself, but he seldom tells outsiders. Since joining the workforce in 1991, only one-third of the time has been spent in Lhasa each year. "The three seasons are in the wild." When asked about the toughest experience, he looked out of the window and smiled a little at the vicissitudes of his face. <br>


　　I have been exploring in the snow and ice for a long time. "Around 2000, four of us were working on an 18-metre rig together, and I suddenly fell about eight metres down. Luckily, I fell on the bottom tower and scratched but there was no harm." He said. <br>


　　26 years of perseverance, for the motherland to explore mineral resources, to bazhi with the iron bone tenderness to write the great love of life. "The communist party member, should be willing to bear hardships, be willing to contribute, can be worthy of the communist party member this glorious title. I'm proud to have the opportunity to contribute to the country." Say to barzasi. <br>


　　A "good mentor" in the eyes of colleagues<br>


　　As the leader of the drilling brigade, he cared about the cultivation and growth of young comrades in barzaxi, and trained many drilling technicians for the brigade over the years. In the process of guiding the apprentices, he compiled the long-term accumulated mechanical operation tips and tricks into a book, and imparted them to others selflessly, bringing out more than 20 technical experts and business backbone successively. <br>


　　These drilling operators, trained by him, are still working in various mining areas and have become a fresh force in the six drilling operations. <br>


　　The 35-year-old had followed barzasi to work on the machine. "I worked as a migrant worker for more than eight years, working in geological teams, and when I met the master, he taught me," he said. I graduated from junior high school and am now the highest-paid of my classmates." <br>


　　"If I want to learn, I will." "I am old and need to train new people. I usually pay special attention to those who can work hard and love to study in the mining area." <br>


　　Zhang huan-bin, deputy director of the Tibet geological survey bureau, said, "in recent years, they have accomplished the tasks assigned by the project department. In the battle of the geological survey of energy resources in northern Tibet, in particular, the geological survey of energy resources in northern Tibet won the construction record of 6000 meters at one fell swoop in 6 months. The depth of a single well set a new record of over 2000 meters for the high-altitude drilling in Tibet, which made a great contribution to the exploration history of energy resources in northern Tibet.”<br>
