	Economic stability and improvement, structural adjustment and optimization, improvement of people's lives...... Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the background of the deep adjustment of the world economy and the new normal development of the domestic economy, China has adhered to the general tone of steady and progressive work, led the new normal economic development, promoted the structural reform on the supply side, made brilliant achievements in economic and social development, and handed in a hard-won brilliant transcript. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	<strong>Economic stability and good progress</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The latest data show that China's Manufacturing Purchasing managers'index (PMI) reached 52.4% in September, the highest level since May 2012, and the pace of manufacturing expansion has accelerated. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	This is the latest footnote for China's steady economic development. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the guidance of the new concept of development, China's economic and social development stands on a new starting point, constantly realizing new leaps and bounds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In the past 5 years, China's economy has maintained rapid growth. From 2013 to 2016, China's GDP grew at an average annual rate of 7.2%, higher than the world's 2.5% and the average growth rate of developing economies of 4% in the same period, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In the past 5 years, China's employment and price situation has remained stable. Statistics show that from 2013 to 2016, urban new employment has remained above 13 million for four consecutive years, and the unemployment rate in 31 large cities has basically stabilized at about 5%. At the same time, prices rose moderately, with consumer prices rising by an average of 2% annually between 2013 and 2016. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In the past 5 years, China's international influence has been significantly improved. In 2016, China's GDP accounted for about 15% of the world's total economic output, more than 3 percentage points higher than in 2012, ranking second in the world. From 2013 to 2016, China's average contribution rate to world economic growth reached more than 30%, exceeding the total contribution rate of the United States, the eurozone and Japan, ranking first in the world. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	"Five years since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held, in the face of profound changes in world conditions and national conditions, China has firmly established and implemented the concept of new development, adapted to grasp and lead the new normal economic development, pioneered and innovated, and moved forward. China's economic and social development has made new brilliant achievements, and the decisive victory is to build a well-off society in an all-round way and win a new major victory. Xing Zhihong, a spokesman for the National Bureau of statistics, said. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	<strong>Structural adjustment and optimization</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	When the national day and the Mid Autumn Festival are double, tourism has become a holiday choice for many of the public. According to a survey conducted by the State Tourism Administration, the number of domestic tourists is expected to reach 710 million between October 1 and October 8, and domestic tourism revenue will reach 590 billion yuan, up 10% and 12.2% respectively from the same period last year. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The social consumption represented by tourism is injecting powerful impetus to economic growth. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, China has paid more attention to structural adjustment and optimization, and pushed the economy to a higher level of development. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	From the perspective of industrial structure, the proportion of service industry continues to improve. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2013, the proportion of added value of service industry surpassed the secondary industry for the first time, becoming the largest industry in the national economy; in 2016, the proportion rose to 51.6%, 6.3 percentage points higher than in 2012, supporting the "half of the country". </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	From the perspective of demand structure, consumption has become the main driving force for economic growth. Statistics show that from 2013 to 2016, the average annual contribution rate of final consumer spending to economic growth is 55%, higher than the total amount of capital formation 8.5 percentage points. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	From the perspective of urban and rural structure, new urbanization is advancing steadily. At the end of 2016, the urbanization rate of the permanent population was 57.35%, 4.78 percentage points higher than at the end of 2012, an average annual increase of 1.2 percentage points. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	From the perspective of spatial pattern, the "three major strategies" have been implemented in depth, and the "four plates" have been pushed forward as a whole. New growth poles and growth zones are gradually forming, and new dynamic energy and new bright spots for regional development are emerging. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	"Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, various departments in various regions have been striving to optimize the industrial structure, constantly improve the demand structure, actively promote urbanization, and strive to promote the coordinated development of the region in accordance with the requirements of leading the new normal economic development. China's economic structure has accelerated the readjustment, the momentum of transformation and upgrading has been good, and the economic development has moved towards a high-end level." Ning Jizhe, deputy director of the national development and Reform Commission and director of the National Bureau of statistics. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	<strong>Continuous improvement of people's livelihood</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Improvement of people's livelihood is the starting point and foothold of economic development. Over the past 5 years, our country has been adhering to the priority of people's livelihood and enhancing people's sense of gain. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Over the past 5 years, the income of residents has been rising. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2016, the per capita disposable income of the country's residents was 23,821 yuan, an increase of 7,311 yuan over 2012, an average annual real growth of 7.4%.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Over the past 5 years, the effect of precision poverty reduction has been remarkable. According to the rural poverty standard of 2,300 yuan per person per year (constant price in 2010), the number of rural poor people in 2016 was 43.35 million, a decrease of 55.64 million compared with 2012. Meanwhile, the growth rate of farmers' income in poor areas is higher than that in the whole country. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Over the past five years, social security coverage has continued to expand, and the social security system covering urban and rural residents has been basically completed. Substantial progress has been made in the integration of the basic medical insurance system for urban and rural residents, and the overall coverage of basic medical insurance has been achieved. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Over the past five years, the education level of residents has improved continuously, the construction of a healthy China has accelerated, and public health services have increased substantially. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	"Over the past five years, we have adhered to the people-centered concept of development, focused on solving outstanding issues of general concern to the people, and promoted the realization of a virtuous circle of economic development and livelihood improvement." He Lifeng, director of the national development and Reform Commission, said. (Xinhua news agency, Beijing, October 2, reporter Chen Weiwei)</p>
