　　In August 2015, fang ruibiao was selected by China association for science and technology to serve as the "first secretary" of the village. From Beijing, the capital, to "old and young, frontier and poor", the reality greatly exceeded his imagination of the poor village: more than 40 kilometers away from the county seat; With an average altitude of 1700 to 2300 meters, mountains are covered by snow in winter. The vast majority of the village are elderly, more than 60 percent are poor households. <br>

　　Colleagues look at the harsh environment. "He came back with a shaved head, and we laughed at him. Ask me, because there are too many fleas, had to shave. Li anan, who also works with the association of science and technology. In addition to "flea pass", there is "language pass". In the first three months, fang ruibiao, a native of shandong, listened to shanxi dialect like foreign language and chatted with fellow villagers on kang, but did not understand a few sentences. <br>


　　"He in the village home association, the ground planer potatoes mow naked oats, does not carry the food also does not shout bitterness." Mention room ruibiao, floor fang ping's village secretary wang junming praise. <br>



　　Not only does not feel bitter, the room rui marks is the fellow villager to treat oneself good: "usually who cooked delicious food call me, as long as do happy business ask me to sit first table." Speaking of these, his joy was on his face. <br>


　　Grounded "science communicator"


　　When I first arrived, the cellphone signals in the village were intermittent, making it difficult for the villagers to communicate with the outside world and severely limiting their development. Fannie was in a hurry. He traveled widely, eventually getting help from the shanxi provincial association of science and technology's "popular science China village e station" project. <br>


　　In June 2016, mobile broadband entered the village, and Lou fangping ended its history of no Internet. In July, the remote villages have achieved full coverage of mobile wireless network in the whole village. Villagers can use the wireless network for free.
