                    　　"only by never forgetting the original intention, remembering the mission and always striving, can the CPC be young forever." Just one week after the close of the 19th CPC national congress, general secretary xi jinping led the standing committee of the political bureau of the CPC central committee to pay a special visit to the site of the CPC national congress in Shanghai and the red boat of nanhu lake in jiaxing, zhejiang province. Looking back on the history of party building, we can look back on the history of struggle, revisit the pledge to join the party, and elaborate on the "red boat spirit". <br>


　　If you go forward, you cannot forget why you started. All the history of our party has been opened by the communist party of China. From the time-honored shikumen building to a leaf of red boat in the south lake of jiaxing, our party was born here, marched from here to the ruling of the whole country. This is the place where the dream of our party set sail, the root of our party, and the spiritual home of generations of communists who never forget their original intention and keep the mission in mind. <br>


　　Do not forget the original heart, remember the mission, the oath engraved in the heart, always firm ideal faith. "The pledge to join the party is not many words. It is not difficult to remember. It is a lifelong commitment." The power of faith lies in practice. For every party member, the pledge to join the party is a mirror, which can only be compared frequently, so as to cultivate themselves and cultivate the party spirit, and always interpret the faith in his heart with practical actions, and strive to the end for the cause of the party and the people. For the party, give firm ideal and faith as the primary task of the party's thought construction, the stand of the communist party of people's spiritual support, solve good world outlook, the outlook on life, values, the problem of "main switch", consciously make communism broad ideal and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics of the firm faith and loyal practitioners. <br>


　　Do not forget the original intention, remember the mission, will continue the spiritual strength, from the party's glorious history to absorb the continuous forward momentum. The red ship splits the waves, the spirit gathers the human heart. The red boat spirit is the pioneering spirit that opens the sky, dares to be the first, firm ideal, indomitable fighting spirit, sets up the party to serve the public, is devoted to the people. From red boat spirit to long march spirit, from daqing spirit to manned space spirit.. The pedigree of the spirit has become a powerful spiritual force inspiring the whole party. Xiushui grand, the red ship still, The Times change, the spirit eternal. On the new journey, we will vigorously carry forward the "red boat spirit" and other valuable spiritual wealth in keeping with the characteristics of The Times. We will be full of confidence and strength and write a new chapter in the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era. <br>


　　Never forget the original intention and keep the mission in mind, we must always maintain the attitude of struggle and constantly push forward the cause of the party and the people. Career development endless, advancing pace never stop. Only by keeping the original intention in mind and making unremitting efforts, can we comfort the history and the ancestors, win the hearts of the people and win The Times. The 19th national congress of the CPC drew a grand blueprint for the development of the cause of the party and the country and started a new journey of struggle. Keep in mind the lofty ideal of communism, the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the fundamental purpose of serving the people heart and soul, always remain modest and prudent, person style of our party to lead the people to create a more happy and beautiful life, to achieve the first goal, one hundred open all-round construction of socialism modernization country new journey. <br>


　　"Its beginning is also simple, its finish also must be huge." 96 years ago, the small red ship carrying the nation's hope has become a giant ship carrying the hope of over 1.3 billion Chinese people. With just a few dozen members, the CPC has grown into the world's largest party with more than 89 million members. Stepping into a new era, our party is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary. Let us continue our struggle with unity and hard work, bearing in mind the pledge of courage and courage that has inspired the Chinese communist party for a century. The initial aspiration and mission of the Chinese communist party is to seek happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. <br>
