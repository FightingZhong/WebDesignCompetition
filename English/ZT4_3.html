	Self confidence is the spiritual backbone of a nation;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Confidence is the driving force of a country;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Confidence, the courage of a political party！</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Throughout thousands of years of history, no civilization in the world, like the Chinese civilization, has a long history and never ceases to live, giving the Chinese people inexhaustible impetus in the inheritance and continuity. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	After a hundred years of suffering and glory, no political party like the Communist Party of China, unswerving, unremitting struggle, leading the Chinese nation through the stormy years ushered in the dawn of a century dream. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Facing the future, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the Chinese nation is advancing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics with unprecedented road confidence, theoretical confidence, institutional confidence and cultural confidence, and striding forward to the great journey of national rejuvenation. </p>
<p align="center">
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	<strong>The Great Way: We have never been so close to the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as we are today, and we have never been so confident as we are today</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	On June 5, 2017, visiting California Governor Gordon Brown boarded a high-speed train from Nanjing to Beijing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	"The high-speed rail looks good, the car is great, and I'm glad to be able to ride." The governor of the largest U.S. state of economic strength walked excitedly back and forth in the carriages, shaking hands with Chinese passengers from time to time, praising the speed and service of China's high-speed trains. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	At this moment, the mileage of China's high speed railways has ranked first in the world. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Time flows. On October 26, 1978, Deng Xiaoping, who was visiting Japan, boarded the Shinkansen No. 81 train from Tokyo to Kyoto. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The staff asked him how he felt about taking the Shinkansen line. Deng Xiaoping replied, "it feels fast and has the urge to run. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The transformation of time and space reflects the great changes of a nation and an epic. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	From China's high-speed rail to its homemade aircraft flying into the blue sky, a backward agricultural country has built the world's most complete industrial system and accelerated its progress on the road to modernization; from being poor and white to being the world's second largest economy, China has contributed more than 30% annually to world economic growth; from exploring the depths of the ocean From the Jiaolong to the Shenzhou spaceship of the traveling stars, China has shown the world the confidence and pride of the next nine days in the five oceans...</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	General secretary Xi Jinping used a firm tone to reveal the spiritual background behind all these miracles——</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	"In today's world, the Communist Party of China, the People's Republic of China and the Chinese nation have the most reason to be confident if we want to say which political party, country and nation can be confident." </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In the evening of July 1, 2017, the harbor of Vitoria was like a fairyland. The fireworks, the moving music and the joyous citizens are the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Whether or not, 20 years ago, the cover of Fortune magazine in the United States wrote big words: "Hong Kong is dying," asserting that the future of Hong Kong after the handover is gloomy. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Today's Hongkong is in full bloom. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	"Today's Hongkong is beyond expectations 20 years ago." Tang Weikang, Consul General of Hongkong and Macao, said. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	From the Hong Kong SAR after its return to China, to the Chinese economy in the process of adjustment, from suspicion of New China to suspicion of reform and opening up... Faced with the speeding "China" train, those wearing "colored glasses" have repeatedly "stunned". When the theory of "China's collapse" collapsed in the face of China's miracles time after time, it was the growing confidence of the Chinese people. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Yes, China has reason to be confident! </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	30 years of rapid growth, 700 million people out of poverty, world stability one pole...... China's road paved the Chinese miracle, and China's miracle confirms China's road. While the world laments that "our planet is sick," China is steadfastly moving along the path it has chosen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Snowflakes flying in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 9, 2017.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	At the launching ceremony of the Global New Year's Exhibition Month of China's theme books, Dr. Pierick Polchet, a PhD student at the University of Geneva, held a French version of Xi Jinping's Talk about Governing State and Politics: "I've heard of this book a long time ago, and everybody says it's a must-read book for understanding Chinese Leaders'ideas and Strategies of governing the country."</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The book, which contains the important speeches of General Secretary Xi Jinping, has been published for thousands of days. It has covered more than 160 countries and regions in the world with more than 6 million copies of circulation, and is popular all over the world. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Yes, the Chinese have reason to be confident! </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Standing in a new historical position, the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has enriched its theory by practice and guided its practice by theory, thus forming a series of new concepts, ideas and strategies for governing the country and governing it, and leading China to a great revival. </p>

	In spring, Tibet is a village, and wild flowers are dotted with green pastures. Here is a beautiful legend: the surrounding snow mountains are Phoenix wings, and the village is located on the back of Phoenix. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In April 2015, Nepal had an earthquake of magnitude 8.1, and the village was almost razed to the ground. Two years later, the villagers witnessed their homes step by step out of the disaster, the realization of the Phoenix Nirvana process. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	"The new house is being built, two floors, 200 square meters." Villager Tsi Wangdoji happily told reporters that the government subsidized nearly 200,000 yuan per household. "Without the Communist Party and the people's government, it is impossible." </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	"The superiority of the system is generated in comparison." Xin Ming, a professor at the Party School of the Central Committee, believes that this superiority is manifested not only in the unprecedented unity in the face of a crisis, unity of will, unity of mind, the ability to overcome difficulties, but also in the difficulty of one side after the crisis, support from all sides, efficient operation, and rapid rise. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Yes, the Chinese have reason to be confident! </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In response to SARS epidemic, Wenchuan earthquake and other major natural disasters and emergencies, overcome the huge impact of the international financial crisis...

<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	The collision of two great civilizations shines with the light of human spirit: in Shakespeare's native Strafford, Shakespeare's "fans" pause for the "Peony Pavilion" singing voice, in Tang Xianzu's hometown Linchuan, Tang's descendants solemnly commemorate Shakespeare... When Shakespeare and "Shakespeare of the East" go hand in hand, the world has a new understanding of Chinese culture. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	In the exchanges and mutual learning with world civilization, the Chinese civilization lasting 5000 years shows its unique charm. As the German newspaper South Deutsche Daily pointed out: "In the face of Western cultural exports, China as the representative of the Third World countries, the era of blindly accepting everything is over." </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	Yes, the Chinese have reason to be confident! </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	By inheriting the traditional culture, sublimating the revolutionary culture and absorbing the achievements of world civilization, the socialist core values have become the core of national soft power. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is rising from the material level to the comprehensive rejuvenation of the material and spiritual, and cultural self-confidence is increasingly becoming the foundation of China's self-confidence. </p>

	People in this spontaneous form praise the nation and the nation. "Amazing, my country!" Full confidence can make the hearts of millions of people vibrate together in 6 short words. </p>

The performance of the letter. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em">
	This self-confidence is becoming the impetus for the Chinese navigational vessel to continue to move forward, the cohesion of the Chinese people, the centripetal force for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the vitality of the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. </p>
